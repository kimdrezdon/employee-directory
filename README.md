# techdegree-project-5: Public API Requests

This project is an employee directory that fetches data from the Random User
Generator API. 

Basic information about each employee is displayed on page load. Clicking
on an employee will open a window displaying more detailed information about
that employee. 

The list of employees can be filtered using the search component at the top
of the page. 

In the modal window, users can toggle through only the displayed employees
without exiting the window.
